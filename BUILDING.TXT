You'll need Visual Studio >= 2010 and the Boost C++ libraries to build this game (grab pre-built Windows version here: http://boost.teeks99.com/ ).

Make sure that boost headers are in the include path and the boost libraries are in the library path!

To build a fresh copy of the game:

	* Go to tools/res_file_builder and open the sln file
	* Build the solution from Visual Studio
	* Copy the resulting executable to the project's root folder
	* From the command line, cd to the project's root folder and run res_file_builder -Rres/ -Oresources.res
	* Open the game's solution file and build it
	* Before running from VS for the first time, copy the dll files from windows/lib32 to Debug/
